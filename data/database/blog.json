(Happy New Year!)</h1><p>The Android Makers team wishes you a very happy new year!üçæ We hope 2019 will bring you happy users, faster apps, plenty of technical challenges and cool Android discoveries! And faster build times too! But above all a lot of joy and happiness for 2019.</p><p>And what better way to start the year than drafting a proposal to share your experience with the awesome Android community :)? The CFP is open and accepts submissions until <strong>January 21st</strong>. </p><p>Below are a few steps if you want to submit a proposal. If anything is unclear or if you have any question, feel free to reach out at contact@androidmakers.fr. </p><p>Looking forward to seeing you on stage in April! </p><h2>1. Find a topic</h2><p>We're very open about the topics as long as they are Android development related. A very technical talk about coroutines-generated bytecode is great. A case study about how you redesigned your app UI/UX is great too. So is a talk about how you organize your team/continuous integration/git repo. </p><p>If you're using Android inside an IOT device, that's awesome. And if you scaled your team to dozens or engineers or managed to release an app as an indie dev, we'd love to hear about it as well. You get the idea, if you like what you do, other will too! Come talk about it.</p><p><plastic-image alt=\"Britt Barak - Who‚Äôs afraid of Machine Learning?
