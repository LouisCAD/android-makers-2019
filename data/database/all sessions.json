Sometimes that’s personal choice, in other cases employers or clients dictate which platform one would have to use. Every year around Christmas time there are articles with titles similar to “Why 20xx will be the year of the Linux desktop”, but has it ever really been *that* year?\r\n\r\nIn 2018, I made the jump from using macOS as my main platform to Linux and since then, people don’t stop to ask me how it went, what I did, what problems I ran into and why *they* could probably never make such a platform transition. The truth is: they - and you - probably could do it just fine as well.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about and explain the pros and cons of my move to Linux. Starting from hardware and distributions choices to very Android-specific development challenges.

Hence we decided to move our Philips Hue Android app to continuous deployment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn that if releasing is painful, you should actually release even more often.

More generally: **A way that works is rarely the only that can.**\r\n\r\nWhen I got started using Kotlin back in 2016, I tried Anko layouts, a library to use the Android Java APIs for Views in a nicer way thanks to Kotlin abilities. Short story, I got back to xml when ConstraintLayout was released, which Anko didn't support back then.\r\n\r\nThen, after thinking about it and finding inspiration, I tried to make an Anko alternative that would be lighter and more flexible. This succeeded and became [Splitties Views DSL](https://github.com/LouisCAD/Splitties), but I didn't stop there.\r\n\r\nAfter completely dropping xml layouts for over a year, I started to envision new ways to make my UIs, leveraging `interface`s that would be contracts that my UI classes would implement.\r\nThis new approach is giving me a flexibility that I like to have: Testing different UI designs is now very easy, and **leveraging coroutines, the code reads like a simple bullet list**, rather than like a small dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll focus on that use case centric way of designing UIs.",

It's possible to keep things simple and still take advantage of what it offers at its core. There are many ways to setup Dagger, and believe it or not, some of them are quite simple. The goal of this talk is to present a simplistic approach to Dagger, where we can take advantage of dependency injection with minimal boilerplate and optimum performance. On top of that, we'll be looking in details on best practices and how to ensure you're taking the most out of Dagger.\r\n\r\nJoin me if you've had unpleasant experiences with Dagger -- or even if you're happy with your current setup -- so we can take a fresh look on how we can work with it.

You started the project and you created your mother activity class, MotherActivity, which inherits from AppCompatActivity. In this class you implement generic behavior for all your activities.  \r\nThen one day, after creating your tenth activities with the same toolbar, you created ActivityToolBar that inherits from MotherActivity and factorizes the toolbar code in a single class.  \r\nAwesome: Factorization by inheritance.  \r\nAnd you keep going this way. Then you created LocationActivity that inherits ToolBarActivity and is able to provide the device location without more code to daughter activities.   \r\nNowadays, you have a graph of mothers classes in your project and it’s a real nightmare; you have ten different types of those classes with code replication because Java doesn’t allow multiple inheritances.  \r\nPerhaps your story is more about fragments. Perhaps you have the both fragments and Activities.  \r\nDid you now that a nice, simple and elegant solution exists which bring back summer in your code (at least for the activities inheritance river of tears).  \r\nAnd guess what, the answer is just in the conference room.

On your first few days, you start getting familiar with the codebase, and... that's precisely when you discover the skeletons. From old and no-longer-maintained dependencies, no architecture consistency, rogue and half-baked experimental technologies, to zero documentation and — obviously — no trace of any tests. Sounds familiar? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how to effectively deal with old codebases while trying to modernize them and bring them up to 2019 quality standards. This will include not only tips, tricks and best practices, but practical guidance on where to start, what to touch (and what to postpone) and how to envision a brighter future.\r\n\r\nTears were shed, blood was drawn, rage was unleashed.

Thanks to EmojiCompat, now Android developers have a way to provide Emoji compatibility for older devices, but does it solve all the issues developers have with Emoji? \r\n\r\nHave you wondered why apps count characters differently depending on the Emoji? Or how gender and skin tone Emoji modifiers work? How can I have a similar functionality as Slack on my app with custom Emoji? Do all your users see the same Emoji? On this talk, you will learn about the different pitfalls developers face when working with Emoji, like code points, the Fitzpatrick modifiers and short-names, you will learn how to use EmojiCompat and I will show you alternatives to it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn:\r\n- What are the problems developers face with Emoji\r\n- How Emoji works\r\n- How to use EmojiCompat including dynamic font downloading\r\n- What is EmojiCompat not solving, and what can you do\r\n- What alternatives are there to EmojiCompat\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, you will be an Emoji expert, no longer afraid of showing □ (tofu) to your users!",

We want to access everything from the point of our fingers and we want that as fast as possible. When an application is taking to long to open or process some data I bet you also feel the urge to search for another solution - or just to throw your smartphone against the nearest wall in despair. And while you think about this, you’re looking at that never ending spinner… that... it just doesn't seem to go away.\r\n\r\n* Google Play and the App Store are full of similar solutions... Why should I bother to keep using this one?\r\nWe can make all sort of optimisations on our code - and yet, sometimes, we can't really make that process as fast as we wanted. There are always some constraints that we can't really avoid - device limitations, network, server, etc. but we can create the illusion of speed - a visual aid that keeps the user busy while, on the background, we are processing his action.\r\n\r\nYes.

In this talk I will give you some insight into the twists and turns.\r\n\r\nEverything starts with the bootloader, which is responsible for basic hardware initialization and loading the Linux kernel. Once Linux is in charge, the remainder of the system can be set up and the first program, called init, can be started. At this point I will look at the way init reads various script files and starts all the native services (also known as daemons).\r\n\r\nInit starts the prototype Java runtime, known as the Zygote. The first instance of the Zygote runs the System Server, which is a container for the most important services that make up the Android framework. One of those services is the Activity Manager. This is the component which starts Android applications, beginning with those that have the persistent property, then the Home App, and finally sending  the BOOT_COMPLETED intent to kick off all other apps that want to start at boot.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate all of the above with code samples and walk-throughs to illustrate how you can make changes to customize each step.",

Logging issues in client-side apps is usually more complicated and requires some planning and usually additional libraries. Ideally you’d be able to track and follow issues across your tech stack and be notified of critical problems. All of these requirements fall under the bigger umbrella of APM (Application Performance Management)\r\n\r\nFor Android, there are a variety of solutions around that cater for the above setup to different degrees. There’s Firebase Crashlytics and Performance Monitoring, Instabug, Appdynamics, Raygun and many others.\r\n\r\nThis talk provides an introduction into APM from the point of view of an Android, Javascript and backend developer. We’ll discuss common product features, their usage patterns and best practices for setting up integration libraries into your apps. The session will also cover typical organisational concerns such as perceived performance overhead or cost and how to counter and debunk these myths by looking at the benefits of a comprehensive error logging solution.

As our community aims for maturity we also need to keep working on bind together the several regions where Android devs are active. Sharing, linking and exchanging from ideas to code, tweets, talks, and slack channels, in many ways, collaboration sparks amazing results and we've been experiencing this in our community. In this talk, we'll share my experience as speaker, how the Latin american android community has developed the past couple of years, how it has integrated with the global community and how everyone can strength the connections with the global community through inclusion, mentorship and empathy.",

Most of those Apps that do arrrrrreeeeee.... Google Apps or applications built by device manufacturers. \r\nWhy? 🤔 It seems like it would be a great way to promote media, features, and engagement with your application by keeping users in your app longer. Give your app the ability to serve your users with pertinent information while they accomplish other tasks.\r\n\r\nIt is because there are a lot of issues once you start actually working with it. Opportunities to cause crashes, lost backstacks, locked-out users and so many other issues come forward. In this talk, we will cover how to use Picture in Picture, but also what those issues are, why they happen, how you can handle them, how are other apps doing it, how some apps are completely failing, and more importantly WHY so many things you rely on as an Android application developer just DO NOT WORK!

Brad Frost developed a methodology called [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)  to create and maintain robust design systems, defining UI components in a bottom up organized hierarchy: from the tinier bricks (atoms and molecules) to the bigger ones (organisms). We took inspiration from it with our own metaphor: Lego bricks.\r\n\r\n### UIKit: an Android implementation of our design system\r\nTo build our design system, we established with designers a UIKit, a pattern library (implemented as an android library) defining every UI component of the app. During the presentation, we will dive in the UIKit to see how:  \r\n - brick components are defined  \r\n - versioning and breaking changes are managed  \r\n - the UIKit is progressively integrated in the app  \r\n",

    "description": "When you transition from a Java-heavy codebase to a Kotlin one, you might think you are “doing Kotlin right” by using language features like extension functions, data classes, smart casting and so forth. Then slowly, the PR comments creep in about making your Kotlin code more “Kotlin-ey” and you enter the debates of “who wrote this better?” You begin to wonder, is the “Kotlin way” of doing things always better than the “Java way”? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will learn how we can improve our Kotlin code to be more idiomatic by going beyond the basics with Single expression functions, Delegated properties and Lazy, De-structuring declarations, Operator overloading, Sequences, Type aliases, Inline classes and more, while leveraging our existing knowledge of Java.\r\n \r\nWith the help of practical examples straight from the Blinkist codebase, we will go over guiding principles or a  “cheatsheet” to have in mind when working with Kotlin - one that I wish I had early on.\u2028\u2028 We will also learn how to apply the Kotlin Style Guide and use static analysis tools to help us write clean, consistent and idiomatic code, thus keeping our teams happy and productive.

According to research from Google, there’s a 1% decrease in the install conversion rate for every 6 MB increase in APK size.\r\n\r\nLarge apps can be problematic for developers too: as new features are introduced in your app, the basic Android project structure provides little guidance for how to best organize and modularize your growing codebase.\r\n\r\nAndroid App Bundles can help us address both of these problems. App Bundles are an upload format that helps serve your users with targeted APKs. They also expose the ability to use Dynamic Feature Modules, which provide a pattern for developers to architect large apps in a way that keeps features modularized.\r\n\r\n- Learn how you can quickly start leveraging App Bundles today to deliver smaller APKs, with no need to refactor your existing project\r\n\r\n- Dive deeper into Dynamic Feature Modules to see how separating features from your base module can promote a manageable architecture and allow you to deliver new features to users post-install\r\n\r\n- See how to combine with Google Play Instant, allowing users to try without downloading and installing",

Android mostly takes care of runtime, but it’s always nice to know what’s happening backstage.\r\nHow code executes at runtime is a completely different story in case of Android. The .dex format has been here for years and everyone is accustomed to it. But there are a lot of complexities going on once the .dex reaches your device. This talk will focussed on analyzing on what happens after your code in Kotlin/Java is compiled, packaged and run on an actual device. We will take a deep dive into .dex format as well as see how runtime has evolved since Android 1.0 and taken a great leap with Android 5.0 and above. In the process, we will also learn how to write runtime efficient code.",

But we’ve all met situations where a certain feature was missing, and we wished were part of the it.\r\n\r\nSince programs are basically functions, and functions are first-class citizen in Kotlin, it’s possible to implement “pseudo-keywords” at a short cost and to great value.\r\n\r\nThere are many useful use-cases for this trick. For instance, you can implement a very transparent caching mechanism , nicely compose asynchronous functions, add a debouncing layer, and many other use cases.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you'll learn about how this techniques works, along with examples that leverage it to solve standard problems an app may encounter. After that, you'll be all set to apply it to your own apps! \r\n​",
